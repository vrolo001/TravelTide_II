# TravelTide_II
SQL-challenge where I query data from Travel Tide,  online booking platform for travel, specializing in discount airplane tickets and hotel accommodations. The four questions are:

1) Return users who have booked and completed at least 10 flights, ordered by user_id.
2) Write a solution to report the trip_id of sessions where:
    a. session resulted in a booked flight
    b. booking occurred in May, 2022
    c. booking has the maximum flight discount on that respective day.
    If in one day there are multiple such transactions, return all of them.
3) Write a solution that will, for each user_id of users with greater than 10 flights, find out the largest window of days between the departure time of a flight and the departure time of the next departing flight taken by the user.
4) Find the user_id’s of people whose origin airport is Boston (BOS) and whose first and last flight were to the same destination. Only include people who have flown out of Boston at least twice.
